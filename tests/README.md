# Akita Smart City Services (ASCS) - Tests

This directory is intended to hold unit tests, integration tests, and potentially simulation scripts for verifying the functionality and robustness of the ASCS plugin.

## Current Status

*No formal tests are implemented yet.*

## Planned Test Categories

1.  **Unit Tests (Host-based):**
    * Target: Individual C++ classes and functions within the ASCS plugin (`ASCSConfig`, Nanopb callbacks, service table logic, etc.).
    * Framework: Google Test, Catch2, or similar C++ testing framework.
    * Goal: Verify logic in isolation from hardware dependencies. Requires mocking/stubbing hardware interactions (Meshtastic API, sensor reads, network clients).
    * Location: `tests/unit/`

2.  **Integration Tests (Simulation/Hardware):**
    * Target: Interactions between different ASCS roles (Sensor -> Gateway -> MQTT).
    * Framework: Python scripts using the Meshtastic Python API to simulate nodes or control real hardware, combined with MQTT client libraries to verify published data.
    * Goal: Verify end-to-end data flow and protocol correctness.
    * Location: `tests/integration/`

3.  **Stress Tests:**
    * Target: Scalability and reliability under load (many nodes, frequent messages, network interruptions).
    * Framework: Simulation environments or controlled hardware deployments.
    * Goal: Identify performance bottlenecks, race conditions, and failure modes.
    * Location: `tests/stress/`

## Running Tests (Future)

*(Instructions on how to build and run the different test suites will be added here once implemented.)*

## Contribution

Contributions to testing are highly valuable and encouraged to ensure the reliability required for a smart city deployment.
